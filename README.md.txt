# Bullet Ship

## Introduction
THIS IS NOT FINISHED BY ANY MEANS. Like, it's SO not done.

This is a Python game utilizing the Pygame framework to mimic the classic "Space Invaders." When it's done, I hope to have a progressive leveling system whereby the player can upgrade his ship to fire different projectiles, have more health, increase ship speed, or unlock other power ups. The enemies will also get stronger and implement different movement patterns.

## INSTALLATION
All of the files needed are in the repo, save for the Pygame framework. You'll need to go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and download the version to match your installation of Python. Personally, I'm on Python 2.7.2 via the Mac OS 10.3-10.6 installer. This matches up with the Pygame 1.9.1 release for 32-bit Python 2.7.x

## CONTROLS
Arrow keys move, left shift fires a projectile. I'll update this as I implement more features.
